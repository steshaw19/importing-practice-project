# importing-practice-project
This is an AIcore module where I practised importing functions, modules, packages, and variables using Python and running the files on the terminal.
## Skills:
- importing functions and variables between files
- assigning aliases to organise and simplify commands
- debugging and editing code

  *I do need to remember to Titlecase the name of the repository e.g.* ***Importing-Practice-Project***
